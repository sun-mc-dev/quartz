**Quartz** uses [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/) as its repository.
Below is all you need to get it running:

```kt
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
  maven {
    name = "papermc"
    url = uri("https://repo.papermc.io/repository/maven-public/")
  }
  maven("https://jitpack.io")
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.SlimifiedxD:quartz:main-SNAPSHOT")
    annotationProcessor("com.github.SlimifiedxD:quartz:main-SNAPSHOT")
    compileOnly("io.papermc.paper:paper-api:1.21.9-R0.1-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

Just like that, you're ready for plugin development with **Quartz**.
